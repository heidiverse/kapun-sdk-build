# Kapun SDK

The Kapun SDK is a Kotlin Multiplatform toolkit for building digital-identity wallets and verifiers on Android and iOS. It includes credential formats, DCQL, issuance, presentation, wallet, cryptography, trust, proximity, and visualization modules.

The repository also contains sample Android wallet and verifier applications and an iOS sample. The samples are demonstrations and may require application-specific wallet or backend configuration.

## What it covers

- Credential formats: ISO mdoc, SD-JWT VC, W3C Verifiable Credentials, BBS, and Open Badges
- Protocols and queries: OpenID4VCI, OpenID4VP, DCQL, and BLE proximity presentation
- Building blocks for wallets, issuers, verifiers, cryptography, trust, and credential visualization

The implementations follow the relevant [OpenID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html), [OpenID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html), [ISO/IEC 18013-5](https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html), [SD-JWT VC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/), [DCQL](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html#name-digital-credentials-query-la), and [Open Badges](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/) specifications.

## Project status

The project is actively evolving. Check the [releases](https://github.com/KapunSDK/kapun-sdk/releases) for published versions; APIs and implementation details may change between releases.

This project evolved from the former Heidi SDK and is now maintained as the Kapun SDK under the KapunSDK organization. Older documentation and package references may still use the Heidi name.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or newer
- Android Studio for the Android samples
- Xcode 15.4 or newer for the iOS sample

## Build the samples

### Android

```bash
./gradlew :examples:android-wallet:assembleDebug
./gradlew :examples:android-wallet:installDebug

./gradlew :examples:android-verifier:assembleDebug
./gradlew :examples:android-verifier:installDebug
```

For a faster local debug build, compile only the ABI used by the connected device:

```bash
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/.gradle/cargo-target"
./gradlew :examples:android-wallet:assembleDebug -PandroidAbis=arm64-v8a
```

Release builds should omit this option so that all supported Android ABIs are included.
The `-PandroidAbis` option is available in the updated UniFFI plugin from PR #19 and will take
effect after the SDK updates to that plugin version.

Use Android-specific Gradle tasks such as `assembleDebug` rather than the root `build` task during
app development. The root build also runs JVM targets; on macOS that includes the macOS Rust
library needed by JVM/JNA binding generation.

Rust outputs are shared between SDK modules when `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set. This is also the way to
reuse the Cargo cache when the SDK is included in another KMP project. Set the same absolute path
in both Gradle builds:

```bash
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="/absolute/path/to/shared/heidi-cargo-target"
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

### iOS

Open `sample-ios-kapun.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select a simulator or device, and run the `sample-ios-kapun` target. Device builds require your own provisioning profile. The sample requires iOS 16 or newer.

The SDK's Rust code is linked as static `.a` files into the Kotlin/Native framework. This is the
default because it gives consumers a single framework to link and avoids separate dynamic
framework embedding and signing. The `kapun-wallet` module exposes an XCFramework task:

```bash
./gradlew :kapun-wallet:assembleKapun-walletReleaseXCFramework
```

Static linkage remains the default. To produce an opt-in dynamic Kotlin/Native XCFramework, use:

```bash
./gradlew :kapun-wallet:assembleKapun-walletReleaseXCFramework \
    -PiosFrameworkLinkage=dynamic
```

The dynamic mode changes the Kotlin/Native framework linkage; the Rust implementation remains
linked from static archives. It is intended for consumers that specifically need a separately
embedded dynamic framework. The resulting framework must be embedded and signed by the app.

If the build needs Android SDK information, set `ANDROID_HOME` and create a root `local.properties` file containing:

```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk
```

The sample sources are available in [`examples/android-wallet`](examples/android-wallet), [`examples/android-verifier`](examples/android-verifier), and [`sample-ios-kapun.xcodeproj`](sample-ios-kapun.xcodeproj).

## Use the published SDK

Released artifacts are available from Maven Central. Add `mavenCentral()` to your repositories and depend on the module you need, for example:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("org.kapunsdk:kapun-wallet:1.0.0")
}
```

Replace `1.0.0` with the release you want.

## Publish locally

To publish JVM artifacts to your local Maven repository:

```bash
./gradlew publishJvmPublicationToMavenLocal -PARTIFACT_VERSION=1.0.0-LOCAL
```

The resulting JVM coordinates use the `org.kapunsdk` group, for example `org.kapunsdk:kapun-trust-jvm:1.0.0-LOCAL`. Publishing all targets requires the corresponding Rust toolchains. Release signing is disabled by default.
