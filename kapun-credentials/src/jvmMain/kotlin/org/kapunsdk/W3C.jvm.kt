 * Blocking adapter over [W3C.OpenBadge303.parse], for Java callers that cannot invoke a suspend
 * function without driving its Continuation by hand. This is interop only — verification itself
 * still happens in [W3C.OpenBadge303.parse].
 *
 * Deliberately JVM-only: parsing dereferences the Open Badges JSON-LD contexts and the proof's
 * verification method over HTTP, so blocking is acceptable on a thread-per-request server but
 * would freeze the main thread on Android/iOS. Those targets only see the suspend variant.
