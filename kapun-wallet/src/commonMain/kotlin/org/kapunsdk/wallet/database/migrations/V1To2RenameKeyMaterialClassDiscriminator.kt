/**
 * This migration renames the class discriminator field for the serialized [KeyMaterial] sealed class in the credential entity.
 * This is required because the [KeyMaterial] file was moved from the kapun-wallet module to the kapun-credentials module.
 * By default, KotlinX Serialization uses the fully qualified class name as the class discriminator, which is different after a package move.
 *
 * Note: Do NOT run migrations in a transaction, since the NativeSqliteDriver runs them in a transaction anyway and causes the migration to fail.
 * See: https://github.com/sqldelight/sqldelight/issues/3812 and https://sqldelight.github.io/sqldelight/2.0.2/multiplatform_sqlite/migrations/
