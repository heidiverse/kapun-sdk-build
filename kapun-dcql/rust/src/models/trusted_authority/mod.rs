//! # Trusted Authories
//!
//! This module exposes the `TrustedAuthorityMatcher` trait that can be used to implement
//! trusted authorities matcher according to https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html#section-6.1-3.10
//! A predefined set of known types is exposed as `TrustedAuthorityQueryType`, which also contains an other element if new types
//! are to be added.
//!
//! ## Registered Matchers
//!
//! To register matchers, the static function `register_matcher` can be used, which registers a specific matcher
//! for the runtime of this application. This function is safe to be called multiple times and results in an NOP if
//! the defined matcher is already present.
